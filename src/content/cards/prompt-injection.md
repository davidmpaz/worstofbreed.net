# Analysis
The belief that a non-deterministic language model can be "secured" through natural language.

**The Reality:**
Prompt Injection is the new SQL Injection, only there are no Prepared Statements against it. No matter how many "Do not do this" rules you set up, a creative user will get the model to ignore them ("Ignore previous instructions..."). You don't have a firewall, you have a polite butler who is easily persuaded to open the safe.
