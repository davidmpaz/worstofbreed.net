## Analysis
Shadow IT in its purest form. A business-critical process depends on an Excel file lying on a network drive.

**The Reality:**
No version control, no tests, no security. When "Herbert from Controlling" retires, the company stands still because no one else understands the 4000 lines of VBA macros that control global pricing.
