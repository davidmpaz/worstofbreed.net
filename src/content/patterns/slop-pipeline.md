## Analysis
The massive use of generative AI without "Human in the Loop" to flood the internet or internal wikis with low-quality content ("Slop").

**The Reality:**
The Signal-to-Noise Ratio goes to zero. Search results become useless. Customers lose trust because they don't know if a product description is real or hallucinated. The internet eats itself as new AI models are trained on the garbage that old AI models produced (Model Collapse).
