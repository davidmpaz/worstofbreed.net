# Analysis
"Vibecoding" describes the phenomenon of building software purely by feeling, prompting LLMs until it *somehow* runs. Understanding the underlying logic? None.

**The Reality:**
You receive a codebase that looks like a patchwork quilt of five different StackOverflow threads and three different Python versions. No one can review the code because even the author doesn't know why line 45 exists. Security vulnerabilities are hallucinated and pushed directly to production.
