        <h2>Why?</h2>

        <p>
            I work as a Principal Consultant at <a
                href="https://innoq.com"
                target="_blank"
                aria-label="INNOQ">INNOQ</a
            >, mostly on software architecture and custom software development.
            We work together on all sorts of projects — from small reviews to
            end-to-end delivery, and workshop formats like Modernization
            Workshops, Eventstorming, or “Painstorming”. We love getting our
            hands dirty alongside our clients’ teams, working as peers with
            different roles and responsibilities.
        </p>
        <p>
            Beyond the pure tech stack (Java, Spring Boot, Microservices, <a
                href="https://scs-architecture.org"
                target="_blank"
                rel="noopener noreferrer"
                aria-label="Self-contained Systems">Self-contained Systems</a
            >, Observability, CI/CD, K8s), I spend a lot of time on
            Domain-Driven Design, decomposing applications, and Conway’s Law and
            Team Topologies.
        </p>

            In a past life, I built BPEL engines (Apache ODE) and did academic
            research on SOA and web services — experiences that still shape how
            I look at systems today. Back then, I kept tripping over the term
            'Best of Breed' and, in a moment of foresight (or cynicism),
            registered <code>worstofbreed.net</code> in 2008. It gathered dust until
            today.
        </p>

        <h3>Why now?</h3>

        <p>
            In our projects, we keep running into wild things that get in our
            way — and in the way of our clients’ success. Organizations often
            trip over their own feet. It impacts their success, and partly ours
            too, since we really just want to help, enable, and ultimately
            succeed together.

            We've actually found <a href="/patterns/trust-me-jwt"
                >The 'Trust Me' JWT Parser</a
            > twice in code reviews.
            <a href="/patterns/kafka-truth-store">The Kafka 'Truth' Store</a> is a
            bit of a caricature, but we've seen the reality close enough.
            <a href="/patterns/k8s-overkill">K8s for a Static Site</a> was a genuine
            request from a client who hoped Kubernetes would bring 'efficiency' to
            a 5-person team.
            <a href="/patterns/generic-domain">The 'Generic' Domain Model</a> is a
            common trap, often emerging because configuration really is easier than
            fighting an overcomplicated release process — even though it only treats
            the symptom, not the cause.
        </p>

        <p>
            Sometimes the industry just spins its wheels, forgetting hard-earned
            knowledge and reinventing flat tires — especially in the frontend
            world with <a href="/patterns/js-bundle-bloat">The 8MB JS Bundle</a
            >. Agile software development is great, but it only works when
            there’s a real willingness for organizational change.
            <a href="/patterns/safe-implementation">The SAFe Implementation</a> shows
            what happens when you try to bypass that. And let's not forget the AI
            bubble, giving us <a href="/patterns/vibecoding-dev"
                >The Vibecoding Dev</a
            > who has lost track of what the code actually does, or <a
                href="/patterns/god-mode-mcp">The 'God Mode' MCP Server</a
            > using protocols for things they definitely weren't meant for (and all
            the security issues that come with it).
        </p>

        <p>
            I felt it was time to collect these stories and share them with a
            bit of humor and exaggeration — not to mock teams, but to make
            recurring patterns easier to spot and talk about. I hope for many
            contributions!

            The Tech Horror Radar is, of course, inspired by ThoughtWorks’ Tech
            Radar, which is a genuinely valuable resource. But a 'negative'
            radar can be valuable too, right? The categories <code
                >BURN WITH FIRE</code
            >, <code>CONTAINMENT BREACH</code>, <code>RESUME ONLY</code>, and <code
                >DESPAIR</code
            > are meant to give direct recommendations on how to handle these patterns
            if you spot them in your own context. With enough Blip contributions,
            we’d love to publish more editions over time.
